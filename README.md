# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Nasa Challenge

In this repository the following challenge and application was made:



- Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
- Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)
Optional:
- Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)
- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D
•	We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested on seeing how you think and organize a project.
•	Please use a linter!
When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
